This is a web app made with Angular 18 and ngrx for state management.
I'm happy with the overall result but I've been running out of time and I'm not fully convinced regarding the following topics:

- UI is not pixel perfect: colors, margins, font sizes could be more precise.
- I had some issues typing the app state and other ngrx elements.
- The app is not unit tested.
- There is no error management other than a redux error action.
- It is not tested on small screens.
- By the end of the day I was wondering if 'reusable component' was meant to be an external library implemented in the main app.

The effective working time has been somewhere between 8-9 hours.
Tested only in Chrome.
Coded with Webstorm, node18 using a macbook air.
